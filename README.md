## Get it!

You can get your own dashboard with these simple steps:

[![Deploy to

Netlify will ask to fork the repo on your GitHub account. Fork it, then Rename
the `.github.sample` folder to `.github`

Run the init.js script: `node init.js`

Push your changes to GitHub, and verify if the GitHub action has started running
in the actions tab. If it runs, you are all set!
